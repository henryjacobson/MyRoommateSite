# MyRoommate

This website intends to bring many of the common problems roommates might run into into a single area such as chores, food, and event planning. 

You can register as a user (real email not needed), connect to an apartment, and edit chores and groceries for your apartment. Or you can register as an admin and edit events and apartments.
